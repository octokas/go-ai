okay I also want to add mongodb; a login page that uses github for admins and simple username and password for guests; a simple calendar feature where we can see the tasks on the day of the calendar, and tasks can be moved from one day to another; api testing and reporting (including instructions guide) with postman and newman reports; and a different hugo theme for the main UI vs the docs, but both will be completely custom themes. I'd like the documentation under the "docs" directory to be using a theme we call "octodoc" and want it to be designed almost identically to the new editions of the Apple Developer documentation sites (@https://developer.apple.com/design/ ). Then for the actual main UI and basically all other pages, I want it to be in the style of the human interface guideance apple puts out, so that you really feel like the GoKas app is actually going to be a fully submersive and beautiful Apple MacOS app. We can totally scrap the pandadocs portion for now, as we can always extend that later. Oh and lastly, I plan on adding the Shift application as an additional Browser for developing the app in, especially the hugo parts. There are no limits on resources other than page load itself we want to be super fast, but we'd rather have beautiful design and an amazing user experience than minimal resource usage.
